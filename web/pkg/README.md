# Hush Network STARK Demo

[![CI](https://github.com/Hush-Network/stark-demo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Hush-Network/stark-demo/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains the proving engine, fee model runtime, benchmark suite, and browser demo that power [demo.hushnetwork.io](https://demo.hushnetwork.io). It is not a full validator or network implementation — consensus, node software, mempool encryption, and the wallet SDK are separate work.

Hush Network is building credential-gated private stablecoin settlement on a purpose-built L1. This repository contains the STARK circuits that enforce it: real zero-knowledge proofs over Mersenne31, no trusted setup, running live in the browser. Every transaction proves ownership, balance conservation, and credential validity without revealing sender, receiver, or amount.

Built on [Stwo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo) (FRI-based STARK prover, Mersenne31 field) with Poseidon2 as the in-circuit hash.

**[Try it live](https://demo.hushnetwork.io)** — browser-based STARK proving, no backend required.

## What each circuit proves

| Circuit | What it proves |
|---------|----------------|
| Payment | The sender owns the input notes, the credential is valid, and the amounts balance. Sender, receiver, and amount stay hidden. |
| Credential Issuance | This wallet was authorized by a verified issuer to participate in the network. |
| Time-Window Audit | This wallet transacted a specific total volume between two timestamps, without revealing individual transactions. |

## Circuits

Three STARK circuits on Stwo over Mersenne31, with full Poseidon2 AIR constraints (S-box decomposed as x^2 -> x^4 -> x^5 for degree-2 constraint compatibility).

**Payment circuit** (2-in-2-out credential-gated transfers)
- Note consumption and creation with nullifier/commitment pairs
- Balance conservation enforced in-circuit (supports both HUSH-only and dual-payment fee paths)
- Nullifier inequality check (prevents double-spend)
- Amount range checks (four 15-bit limbs per amount, radix 2^15, with carry-propagation conservation)
- Credential verification: issuer, expiry, and Merkle inclusion checked inside the proof
- Three depth-20 Merkle path verifications per transaction (2 note paths + 1 credential path)
- ~44,400 trace columns

**Credential issuance circuit**
- Derives issuer identity from private key via Poseidon2
- Computes credential commitment over (issuer, subject, expiry, secret)
- Verifies issuer Merkle inclusion (depth-20)
- ~14,000 trace columns

**Time-window audit circuit** (16 transaction slots)
- Proves aggregate volume over a time window without revealing individual transactions
- Per-transaction: binary window flag, conditional contribution, 24-bit timestamp range checks
- Sum constraint: contributions equal claimed total
- Credential verification with expiry range check
- Merkle inclusion for credential set

## Fee models

Two fee models are implemented and under evaluation. Both are functional and the architecture supports toggling between them at the protocol level.

**HUSH-only gas model:** All transaction fees are denominated in HUSH, the native protocol token. This is the industry-default approach for L1 networks. Implemented at the circuit and runtime level.

**Dual-payment fee model:** Transaction fees can be paid in the same stablecoin being transacted, or optionally in HUSH. The sender pays amount plus fee; the receiver gets the exact intended amount. Fee accounting, epoch accrual, and validator payout are handled by `dual_fee_runtime.rs` and `accounting.rs`. The runtime logic is complete; fee extraction is not yet enforced at the circuit constraint level.

The decision on which model to launch with will be made after further evaluation and investor input. Both paths are actively maintained.

## Performance

Measured on AMD Ryzen 9 / release build (April 7, 2026). 10 iterations per circuit. Single-threaded, no batching, no recursion.

| Circuit             | Prove (avg) | Prove (min) | Prove (max) | Verify (avg) |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Payment             |      970ms  |      907ms  |     1034ms  |       119ms  |
| Mode A Bundle       |     1058ms  |     1003ms  |     1122ms  |       119ms  |
| Mode B Bundle       |     1661ms  |     1627ms  |     1702ms  |       191ms  |
| Credential Issuance |      285ms  |      269ms  |      322ms  |   (combined) |
| Time-Window Audit   |      291ms  |      281ms  |      313ms  |   (combined) |

These improve significantly with recursive batching and multi-threading. See [benchmarks/](benchmarks/) for full details.

## Tests

110 tests covering:
- Valid proof generation and verification for all three circuits
- Balance conservation rejection (mismatched inputs/outputs)
- Nullifier reuse rejection (double-spend prevention)
- Expired credential rejection
- Unauthorized issuer rejection
- Invalid time window rejection
- Mismatched audit total rejection
- Poseidon2 AIR correctness (output verification, column count validation)
- Owner derivation consistency
- Fee model accounting (both HUSH-only and dual-payment paths)
- Payment transaction validation and fixtures

## Cryptographic stack

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Proving system | STARK (FRI) | Transparent, no trusted setup, post-quantum |
| Prover | Stwo | Fastest production STARK prover, Rust, open source |
| Field | Mersenne31 (M31) | Native to Stwo, fast field arithmetic |
| In-circuit hash | Poseidon2 (width-16, Plonky3 constants) | STARK-optimized, efficient over M31 |
| Commitment backend | Poseidon252 (native) / Blake2s (WASM) | |
| Domain separation | 9 domains (owner, nullifier, note, credential, Merkle, tx binding, sender binding) | Prevents cross-context hash collisions |
